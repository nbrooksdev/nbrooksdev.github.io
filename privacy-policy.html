                        <li>
                            If prompted for consent within the service, respond that you do not consent or close the prompt with no selection.
                            This method is only available where it is required by local law.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If "Privacy Options" is available in the menu within the service, navigate to "Menu" > "Privacy Options" and respond to the prompt that you do not consent or that you do not want your data sold or shared.
                            The wording of the prompt will depend on local law.
                            This method is only available where it is required by local law.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Within an ad window visible in the service, click on the AdChoices icon (the blue "i" within a triangle), select "Ad options", and toggle off "Personalize ads on this app".
                            Select "Learn more" beneath "Personalize ads on this app" to visit a web page hosted by our advertising service provider detailing this option.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Prevent our services from accessing your device's advertising ID.
                            Following are details by device operating system:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Apple's IDFA is the iOS advertising ID.
                                    By default, our services do not utilize the IDFA.
                                    Access to the IDFA can be managed for each service by opening "Settings" on your device and navigating to "Privacy and Security" > "Tracking".
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Google's AAID is the Android advertising ID.
                                    Our services utilize the AAID unless access to this ID is restricted by the user.
                                    The AAID can be reset or deleted by opening "Settings" on your device and navigating to "Privacy" > "Ads".
                                    On devices with older Android software versions, the option to "Opt out of Ads Personalization" may appear instead of the option to delete the AAID.
                                    If a "Privacy" > "Ads" path does not appear in "Settings", an update to a newer Android software version may be required to use this method of opting out.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                Our services are intended for a general audience and do not address or target anyone under the age of 13.
                We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.
                If we become aware that we have collected personal data from someone under the age of 13 without parental consent, we will delete the relevant data in a timely manner.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
            <p>
                We will make changes to this policy if there are substantive changes to the types of data we collect or to other related policies.
                We may also make non-substantive changes to this policy to improve clarity or to name a new service.
                We will notify you if we make a substantive change.
                The notification will be a prompt within the service and will require your consent in order for you to continue using our service.
                As an exception, Square the Circles cannot present such a message as it does not establish a connection to the internet.
                Our other services will check if a notification is required during launch.
                If you prevent our services from connecting to the internet, do not routinely re-launch our services, or are a user of the Square the Circles service, you must visit this page to stay informed of policy changes.
